    "text": "Introduction to Machine Learning\n\nWhat is an algorithm?\nAn algorithm is any function that computes an output from an input. We already use algorithms in everyday life and in clinical medicine. For example, here is an algorithm that you might use to determine when to walk to JMEC based on 3 different variables:\ny = some_algorithm_for_when_to_walk_to_jmec(\n    how_long_does_it_typically_take_to_walk_to_campus,\n    how_much_sleep_did_I_get_last_night,\n    is_class_mandatory\n)\nwhere y is when you decide to walk to campus.\nSome algorithms can be written down exactly. For example, compute the anion gap given patient values, or compute the MAP of a patient given their blood pressure.\nOther algorithms are harder to express on paper. For example, how to run a code or how to determine whether to admit a patient or not.\nComputers can run algorithms that can be written down exactly. But how can we teach them how to run algorithms that are hard to express? To answer this question, let’s reflect on how we as students learn algorithms that might be hard to express.\n\n\nLearning by Observing\nComputers can learn by observation, much like how medical students learn! Consider some of the following scenarios:\nA Database of Genomes\nDuring your clinical research year, your advisor gives you a large dataset of many different patient genomes. We can denote this dataset of \\(n\\) patients as the variable \\(\\mathcal{D}_n\\). By analyzing \\(\\mathcal{D}_n\\), we try to gain insights into which genes make individuals unique, and which ones all patients share in common.\nA Randomized Control Trial\nYour research mentor is impressed with your analysis and gives you a new project: investigating if a new drug abastatin lowers patient cholesterol levels. He gives you a large dataset of anonymized patient data containing two variables: whether the patient was given abastatin or placebo (\\(x\\)), and whether the patient had a reduction in their cholesterol levels (\\(y\\)). By analyzing this dataset, we try to learn whether or not abastatin is an effective drug for hypercholesterolemia.\nA Patient with Sepsis\n\n\n For those of you with a machine learning background, A Database of Genomes is an unsupervised learning problem, A Randomized Control Trial is a supervised learning problem, and A Patient with Sepsis is a reinforcement learning problem. You can learn more about each of these types of machine learning problems here!\nA 52 year-old male presents with acute-onset altered mental status and fever. Vitals are notable for BP 90/60 and T 103.4. We can denote the patient as a variable \\(x\\) consisting of all of the relevant attributes of the patient: their HPI, past medical history, current lab values and vitals, etc. Every patient in the world can be expressed in terms of these features - we can write the set of all possible patients in the world as \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) (a set which is obviously incredibly large). \\(x\\sim \\mathcal{X}\\), which means that our particular 52 year-old patient in front of us is sampled from the population \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) of all patients.\nOn our first day as a medical student, we might not know what to do with this patient. Do we admit them and start them on IV antibiotics? Do we call a neurology consult? Do we just send the patient home? Each of these clinical interventions can be thought of as an action \\(a\\), which is similarly sampled from the space of all possible actions \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) that we can take to try to help the patient get better.\nAfter observing a patient \\(x\\) and performing an action \\(a\\), we monitor the patient to see if they improve. The patient’s outcome can be denoted as a variable \\(y\\) (for example, \\(y=0\\) if the patient deteriorates and \\(y=1\\) if the patient gets better). We observe the clinical outcome \\(y\\) sampled from the set of all possible outcomes \\(\\mathcal{R}\\).\nOver the course of medical school, we see hundreds if not thousands of tuples \\((x, a, y)\\) sampled from \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{R}\\) through clerkships, sub-Is, exams, and UWorld, and use this dataset of patient-outcome pairs to learn hard-to-write-down algorithms for choosing the best clinical intervention \\(a\\) given a patient \\(x\\).\nIn other words, we learn by observation.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to “learn”?\nNo patient is exactly identical to any other patient, including the patients that you learn from. If all you can do is regurgitate the dataset you learned from, this is not learning! Put simply…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning = Generalization\n\n\n\nAfter observing the many different patient cases and outcomes, we want to be able to generalize to new patients in the future, such that we know what to do as clinicians for future, previously unknown patients.\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning as a Framework\nMachine learning (ML) uses the exact same framework of learning through observation to learn hard-to-write-down algorithms from data as exact steps that a computer can execute.\n\n\n Just like how we all have different mnemonics and mental maps on how to approach clinical reasoning, the exact steps in the algorithm that ML learns may not be the same as the steps that clinicians learn! This is an important problem that researchers are still trying to solve.\nThe fundamental goal of machine learning is to learn hard-to-write-down algorithms from past observations to hopefully make accurate predictions for future observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat problems might cause algorithms to generalize poorly to new patients?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons. Here are a couple:\n\nNew patients are very different from the patients used to train the algorithm. TODO\nThe algorithm had too many inputs and learned relationships between inputs and outputs that are not true. For example, if we try to predict the weather based on features like TODO\n\nWhat other problems did you think of? Are there any ways to fix the problems that we’ve identified?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen can machine learning be a helpful tool?\nConsider the following example cases. Would you want to use machine learning in each of these cases?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Given patient lab values and health record data, ML predicts the age of a patient.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, it’s easy to just look up the age of a patient from the patient chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Given patient blood pressure values, ML predicts the patient’s MAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, computing MAP is an easy-to-write-down algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Given patient lab values, imaging data, genomic data, and other attributes, ML predicts whether the patient is at risk for a cancer with no known cure.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, even if ML derives an algorithm for this task, there is nothing actionable that we can do about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Given patient bowel sound recordings, ML predicts the probability a patient has an SBO.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, we don’t have any datasets of patient bowel sounds mapping to the presence/absence of an SBO, so there are no prior observations for ML to learn from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Given patient lab values, ML predicts the probability a patient has ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (RPI) deficiency, the second rarest disease in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, we don’t have nearly enough observations of patients with RPI deficiency. Even if we did have enough data to learn this algorithm, we also would rarely/never even need to use this algorithm.\n\n\n\nIn summary, ML is useful for tasks that are\n\nhard-to-write-down;\nassociated with a lot of prior observations; and\ncan lead to actionable utility for patients and/or clinicians by automating hard, repetitive, and/or common tasks.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Medicine Discussion\nShould AI be used to improve access to mental health resources?\n\nOverview Article: Stade EC, Stirman SW, Ungar LH, Boland CL, Schwartz HA, Yaden DB, Sedoc J, DeRubeis RJ, Willer R, Eichstaedt JC.

    "text": "What is Bias?\nBias is a term that is often used broadly but has a very precise definition. Bias is always defined with respect to two related concepts: (1) protected attribute(s), and (2) a definition of harm.\n\nA protected attribute is an attribute about a patient that we want to ensure there is no bias against. Examples of protected attributes might be patient age, gender, or ethnicity.\nA definition of harm is how we choose to define when bias is present. Common definitions of harm include an algorithm’s overall error rate, or its false positive or false negative rate.\n\nWhen we choose the protected attribute and a definition of harm, we can then define when an algorithm is biased. Namely, an algorithm is biased if it causes an increase in harm for a subpopulation of patients with respect to the protected attribute(s). For example, if we define the protected attribute as a patient’s race and the definition of harm as the algorithm’s error rate, then the algorithm is biased if its error rate is higher for Black Americans than White Americans."

    "section": "Key Terminology: Binary Classification",
    "text": "Key Terminology: Binary Classification\nIn this section, we primarily focus on understanding algorithmic bias as they pertain to binary classifiers, which are algorithms that seek to classify patients into one of two categories. Binary classification is common in clinical medicine: we often want to classify patients by…\n\ndiagnosing them with a disease or not;\nidentifying if they are sick or not; or\ndeciding whether a patient can be discharged or not.\n\nIn each of these situations, our goal is to label an input patient using a positive label or a negative label.\nAs with any clinical task, algorithms rarely get 100% accuracy. We may mistakenly diagnose a patient as having a disease when they in fact do not have it, or decide that a patient can be discharged when they need to stay in the hospital for additional treatment. These are situations where an algorithm might cause harm to a patient.\n\nAn algorithm’s false positive rate (FPR) is the rate at which an algorithm falsely assigns the positive label to a patient (i.e., telling a patient AMAB1 that they are pregnant).\nAn algorithm’s false negative rate (FNR) is the rate at which an algorithm falsely assigns the negative label to a patient (i.e., telling a patient that is 8 months pregnant that they are not pregnant).\nAn algorithm’s overall error rate is the rate at which an algorithm assigns the wrong label to a patient.\n\n1 Assigned male at birth, meaning the patient has XY sex chromosomes.In general, we want to minimize an algorithm’s FPR, FNR, and overall error rate. FPR, FNR, and overall error are commonly used definitions of harm in assessing for algorithmic bias.\nIt is important to recognize that the consequences of false positives and false negatives can be different depending on the task. For example, in colon cancer screening, a false negative (e.g., missing a precancerous polyp on a colonoscopy) is much worse than a false positive (e.g., taking out a potential polyp that turns out not to be precancerous). This means that the consequence of a false negative is much more significant than that of a false positive for colon cancer screening."

    "text": "Sources of Bias\nWhat causes an algorithm to be potentially biased? Bias can be due to a wide variety of reasons, including population-dependent discrepancies in…\n\n\n Other than the sources listed below, what are some other potential causes of bias that algorithms might suffer from?\n\nAvailability of Data\nEspecially for machine learning algorithms, it is important for models to be trained on diverse datasets from many different patient populations. If the dataset used to train a model is composed of 90% White patients and only 10% Black patients, then the resulting algorithm will likely perform inaccurately on Black patients.\nThis is a common problem not just for machine learning algorithms, but also in insights from randomized control trials! For example, take a look at the 2023 ISCHEMIA Trial2 from the American Heart Association. According to Supplementary Table 1, approximately 77% of the patients in the study were male. Would you trust the insights from the trial for your female patients?2 Hochman JS, Anthopolos R, Reynolds HR, et al. Survival after invasive or conservative management of stable coronary disease. Circulation 147(1): 8-19. (2022). doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONA HA.122.062714. PMID: 36335918\n\n\nPathophysiology\nDifferent patient populations may have different underlying mechanisms of disease, and so lumping patients together using a single predictive algorithm may limit that algorithm’s ability to represent all the different mechanisms of disease.\n\n\nQuality of Data\nSuppose we have two CT scanners in the hospital: Scanner 1 and Scanner 2. Scanner 1 was made in 1970 and Scanner 2 was made in 2020; as a result, Scanner 1 produces very low-quality, low-resolution images compared to Scanner 2. If we learn an algorithm to diagnose a disease from CT scans, then the algorithm will likely perform worse on input scans from Scanner 1. This is because lower quality scans contain less information about the patient, and so patients imaged with Scanner 1 will be inherently less predictable.\n\n\nHow Data is Acquired\nThe data that we choose to collect to learn an algorithm can also introduce biases. For example, suppose you are conducting a study investigating the relationship between number of leadership positions and success in medical school for medical students. Focusing only on leadership positions might result in algorithms that are biased against students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who can succeed in medical school but may have to focus on things such as taking care of loved ones or part-time employment that was not factored into the initial algorithm design. In summary, it is important to be thoughtful about not only algorithms, but also datasets as potential sources of bias!\n\n\n How might collecting too many data features bias algorithms?"

    "text": "Case Studies\nTo better understand the sources of algorithmic bias and why they are important, let’s look at some commonly cited case studies (both clinical and non-clinical):\n\nPulmonary Function Testing (PFT)\nPFTs are used in clinical practice to evaluate lung health. The patient’s measured lung values are compared with the expected lung values given the patient’s age, height, sex assigned at birth, and ethnicity among other factors.\nResearchers have found that using a patient’s race as input into the expected lung value calculation can result in different PFT results, with implications for access to certain disease treatments and disability benefits. However, they also report that using race has also allowed patients to benefit from treatment options that they would have otherwise not had access to based on societal guidelines.\nThe 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines currently offer both race-specific and race-neutral algorithms, leaving it up to the discretion of the provider to determine how PFTs are used in clinical practice. Other historical examples of bias in clinical medicine include eGFR calculations, opioid risk mitigation, and care assessment evaluation as functions of race and other patient demographic information.

Health Equity 7(1): 809-16. (2023). doi: 10.1089/heq.2023.0037. PMID: 38076213\n\n\nCOMPAS/ProPublica\nIn 1998, a private company built the COMPAS algorithm, which is an algorithm that takes in information about arrested/incarcerated individuals and returns a prediction of how likely the individual will commit future crimes. Inputs into the COMPAS algorithm include individual demographics, criminal history, personal and family history, and the nature of the charged crime among others.\nThe COMPAS algorithm is used in the real world to help the judiciary system set bonds and evaluate arrested individuals. High (low) COMPAS scores mean more (less) likely to commit future crimes.\nProPublica is a nonprofit journalism organization that conducted an independent evaluation of the COMPAS tool in 2016. Their main finding was that COMPAS is biased.\n\nThe distribution of COMPAS risk scores skews low for white individuals but more uniform for black individuals. In other words, white individuals were more often “let off the hook” than black individuals for the same crime.\nLooking at historical data, the false positive rate (FPR) was significantly higher for black individuals than white individuals. In other words, COMPAS was more likely to incorrectly predict that a black individual would commit a future crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes this mean that the COMPAS algorithm is racially biased (using the risk score as the definition of harm)? What are some potentially other reasons why white scores may be lower?\n\n\n\n\n\nOther reasons might include…\n\nthe nature of the subjective questions asked about the individual’s personal and family history;\nother causal variables like upbringing and socioeconomic status that might be racially correlated; and\nthe number of black individuals used in the development of the COMPAS algorithm.\n\nWhat other potential reasons did you think of?\n\n\n\nCOMPAS Developer Response to the ProPublica report was that COMPAS is not biased.\n\nArea under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), a metric of classifier “goodness,” for black and white subpopulations are equal. Therefore, COMPAS is not biased and we can make sure the FPR of both populations are equal by setting different classifier thresholds for the two subpopulations.\n\n\n\nImage Generation Using Google Gemini\nIn late 2023, Google introduced a new generative AI model called Gemini, which is able to complete a variety of tasks such as generating images from input text descriptions. Gemini was released to the public, and users quickly found that Gemini stood out from prior generative models because it was able to generate more diverse sets of images, such as producing images of people of color when prompted for an “American woman” or producing images images of women when prompted for historically male-dominated roles, such as a lawyer or an engineer. This was seen as a major step forward in tackling the bias associated with other generative models.44 Nicoletti L and Bass D. Humans are biased. Generative AI is even worse. Bloomberg. (2023). Link to article\nHowever, an unintended side effect was that the model also generated historically inaccurate images when prompted for images of “1943 German soldiers” or “US senators from the 1800s.” In these settings, it would be inaccurate to generate images of people of color given these input prompts."

    "section": "How can we reduce bias?",
    "text": "How can we reduce bias?\nThe most common reason why bias occurs in machine learning is that we train models to be accurate on the “average” patient. In other words, if there are more patients from one subpopulation than another in the dataset used to learn an algorithm, then the algorithm will almost certainly be more accurate on the majority population. Naively learning algorithms in this fashion will result in accurate but biased models.\nOn the other hand, we could instead implement a completely random algorithm - for example, deciding whether a patient should be admitted or not solely based on the flip of a coin. Such an algorithm would be completely unbiased, but not very accurate.\nThese two examples demonstrate that in general, there is a tradeoff between accuracy and bias. As we train models to be more accurate, they often become more biased at the same time. Researchers are currently working on ways to overcome these limitations5, but this is an incredibly common empirical finding that we see in practice.5 Chouldechova A, Roth A. The frontiers of fairness in machine learning. arXiv Preprint. (2018). doi: 10.48550/arXiv.1810.08810\n\nFairness is not Compositional\nWhy is training both fair and accurate models hard? There are a lot of complex answers to this question, but one important reason is that fairness is not compositional. In simpler terms, imagine that we have a screening tool that seeks to predict whether a patient has a disease with 50% prevalence in the population. The algorithm has been shown to be unbiased against patient gender (male versus female) with regards to sensitivity, and also unbiased against patient color (“blue” versus “green” people) using the same metric. Does this mean that the algorithm is also unbiased against blue female people?\nNo! The screening tool can still be biased against blue female people in this toy case. Here’s an illustrative diagram of one possibility:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fairness Gerrymandering. Adapted from Kearns M, Neel S, Roth A, Wu ZS. Preventing fairness gerrymandering: Auditing and learning for subgroup fairness. Proc Int Conf Mach Learn 80: 2564-72. (2018). Link to Paper\n\n\nIn Figure 1, we can see that our screening tool is “fair” with respect to gender and color by only accepting individuals that are either both blue and male or both green and female. Ensuring that models are fair for certain subgroups doesn’t mean that those models are also fair for members of the intersections of those groups, or other entirely unrelated subgroups. In other words, fairness conditions do not compose. This is why fairness is such a hard problem to tackle!\n\n\nWhat can we do about this as clinicians?\nThe most important thing to help reduce bias is recognize that all real-world algorithms are biased! How algorithms are biased and to what extent depend on your definition of harm and the patient attribute(s) that you’re focusing on. These definitions inherently differ between persons and scenarios. Recognizing our own biases in the algorithms used by both computers and humans is critical so that we make the best decisions for each individual patient."

Would you be comfortable having it used to determine the outcomes of the judicial system for close friends or family?\nIn the hands-on tutorial, we explored how even simple binary classifiers can be biased in scenarios such as determining loan repayment and supplemental oxygen requirements. What other analogous “binary classifier” clinical situations have you encountered? How did you decide your strategy on how to set your own “threshold” for positive and negative labels? Did your strategy vary between different patients?"

    "text": "Summary\nBias is defined based on (1) protected attribute(s) and (2) a definition of harm. Because our definition of harm can vary from person-to-person, bias is often subjective. The impact of bias depends on the clinical scenario and the real-world implications of the definition of harm. It is important to recognize our own internal sources of bias in addition to the biases of clinical and computational algorithms."
